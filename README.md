Summary
This is a password creation tool for creating strong passwords. It has three modes where it can be used to create a completely random password based on specifications, strengthen an existing password, or create a passphrase. Understand that while this may create strong passwords it is no guarantee of their strength. All passwords can potentially be broken. Currently the only supported OS is Linux. Requires python gi and os. 

Installation
For linux run the setup_linux.sh file. This will create a .password_engine folder in the Home directory and will make a clickable desktop icon to launch. You may need to change the file to an executable before it is able to run. Do this either by (Right click -> Properties -> Executable as a program) or run the command in the terminal (chmod +x setup_linux.sh)

Uninstall
For linux run the uninstall_linux.sh from the .password_engine folder. This will remove all files associated with the app. You may need to ensure that it has executable permissions before running.
